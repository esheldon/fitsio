[![build wheels/sdist](https://github.com/esheldon/fitsio/actions/workflows/wheel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/esheldon/fitsio/actions/workflows/wheel.yml) [![tests](https://github.com/esheldon/fitsio/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/esheldon/fitsio/actions?query=workflow%3Atests)

A Python library to read from and write to `FITS` files.

## Description

This is a Python extension written in C and Python.  Data are read into
numerical Python arrays.

A version of `cfitsio` is bundled with this package, there is no need to install
your own, nor will this conflict with a version you have installed.

## Some Features

- Read from and write to image, binary, and ASCII table extensions.
- Read arbitrary subsets of table columns and rows without loading all the data
  to memory.
- Read image subsets without reading the whole image.
- Write subsets to existing images.
- Write and read variable length table columns.
- Read images and tables using slice notation similar to `numpy` arrays. (This is like a more
  powerful `memmap`, since it is column-aware for tables.)
- Append rows to an existing table.
- Delete row sets and row ranges, resize tables, or insert rows.
- Query the columns and rows in a table.
- Read and write header keywords.
- Read and write images in tile-compressed format (`RICE`, `GZIP`, `PLIO` ,`HCOMPRESS`).
- Read/write `GZIP` files directly.
- Read unix compress (`.Z`, `.zip`) and bzip2 (`.bz2`) files.
- `TDIM` information is used to return array columns in the correct shape.
- Write and read string table columns, including array columns of arbitrary
  shape.
- Read and write complex, bool (logical), unsigned integer, signed bytes types.
- Write checksums into the header and verify them.
- Insert new columns into tables in-place.
- Iterate over rows in a table. Data are buffered for efficiency.
- Python 3 support, including Python 3 strings.

## Examples

```python
import fitsio
from fitsio import FITS,FITSHDR

# Often you just want to quickly read or write data without bothering to
# create a FITS object.  In that case, you can use the read and write
# convienience functions.

# read all data from the first hdu that has data
filename='data.fits'
data = fitsio.read(filename)

# read a subset of rows and columns from a table
data = fitsio.read(filename, rows=[35,1001], columns=['x','y'], ext=2)

# read the header
h = fitsio.read_header(filename)
# read both data and header
data,h = fitsio.read(filename, header=True)

# open the file and write a new binary table extension with the data
# array, which is a numpy array with fields, or "recarray".

data = np.zeros(10, dtype=[('id','i8'),('ra','f8'),('dec','f8')])
fitsio.write(filename, data)

# Write an image to the same file. By default a new extension is
# added to the file.  use clobber=True to overwrite an existing file
# instead.  To append rows to an existing table, see below.

fitsio.write(filename, image)

#
# the FITS class gives the you the ability to explore the data, and gives
# more control
#

# open a FITS file for reading and explore
fits=fitsio.FITS('data.fits')

# see what is in here; the FITS object prints itself
print(fits)

# By default they are read into fixed-length fields in the output array.
# You can over-ride this by constructing the FITS object with the vstorage
# keyword or specifying vstorage when reading.  Sending vstorage='object'
# will store the data in variable size object fields to save memory; the
# default is vstorage='fixed'.  Object fields can also be written out to a
# new FITS file as variable length to save disk space.

```

## Installation

The easiest way is using `pip` or `conda`. To get the latest release

```bash
pip install fitsio

# update fitsio (and everything else)
pip install fitsio --upgrade

# if pip refuses to update to a newer version
pip install fitsio --upgrade --ignore-installed

# if you only want to upgrade fitsio
pip install fitsio --no-deps --upgrade --ignore-installed

# for conda, use conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge fitsio
```

You can also get the latest source tarball release from

```url
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fitsio
```

or the bleeding edge source from GitHub or use git. To check out
the code for the first time

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esheldon/fitsio.git
```

Or at a later time to update to the latest

```bash
cd fitsio
git update
```

Use `tar xvfz` to unpack the file, enter the `fitsio` directory and type

```bash
pip install .
```

## Requirements

- python >=3.8
- a C compiler and build tools like `make`, `patch`, etc.
- numpy (See the note below. Generally, numpy 1.11 or later is better.)

### Do not use `numpy` 1.10.0 or 1.10.1

There is a serious performance regression in `numpy` 1.10 that results
in `fitsio` running tens to hundreds of times slower.  A fix may be
forthcoming in a later release. Please comment on GitHub issue
[numpy/issues/6467](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6467)
here if this has already impacted your work

## Tests

The unit tests should all pass for full support.

```bash
pytest fitsio
```

Some tests may fail if certain libraries are not available, such
as bzip2.  This failure only implies that bzipped files cannot
be read, without affecting other functionality.

## Linting and Code Formatting

We use the `pre-commit` framework for linting and code formatting. To
run the linting and code formatting, use the following command

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

## Notes on Usage and Features

### `cfitsio` bundling

We bundle cfitsio partly because many deployed versions of cfitsio in the
wild do not have support for interesting features like tiled image compression.
Bundling a version that meets our needs is a safe alternative.

### Array Ordering

Since numpy uses C order, FITS uses fortran order, we have to write the TDIM
and image dimensions in reverse order, but write the data as is.  Then we need
to also reverse the dims as read from the header when creating the numpy dtype,
but read as is.

### `distutils` vs `setuptools`

As of version `1.0.0`, `fitsio` has been transitioned to `setuptools` for packaging
and installation. There are many reasons to do this (and to not do this). However,
at a practical level, what this means for you is that you may have trouble uninstalling
older versions with `pip` via `pip uninstall fitsio`. If you do, the best thing to do is
to manually remove the files manually. See this [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/402359/how-do-you-uninstall-a-python-package-that-was-installed-using-distutils)
for example.

### Python 3 Strings

As of version `1.0.0`, fitsio now supports Python 3 strings natively. This support
means that for Python 3, native strings are read from and written correctly to
FITS files. All byte string columns are treated as ASCII-encoded unicode strings
as well. For FITS files written with a previous version of fitsio, the data
in Python 3 will now come back as a string and not a byte string. Note that this
support is not the same as full unicode support. Internally, fitsio only supports
the ASCII character set.

## TODO

- HDU groups: does anyone use these? If so open an issue!
